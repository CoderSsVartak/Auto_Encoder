# Auto_Encoder
Auto encoder on mnist dataset

The model improves the clarity of zoomed black and white images. 
It is also capable of removing noise from images while maintaining the shape of the digits of the mnist dataset

Dependencies:
1. Tensorflow - backend for keras
2. Keras - Deep Learning API used to create the model
3. numpy - To analyse images and to perform opertaions on images
4. matplotlib - to visualise the images.
